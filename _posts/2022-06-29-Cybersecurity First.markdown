Welcome to my website. My name is Justin Johnson, and this is Cloud Defense Labs. I am an avid Information Technology/Cybersecurity Analyst who believes that there is always something to learn in this field. I also tinker with technology to the point to where if it ain’t broke, fix it until it is… (then secure it).

Information Technology should always start with Cybersecurity at the forefront of the stack, now more so than ever. Hopefully this website will help those with a passion for Information Technology and/or Cybersecurity get along further in their career.
